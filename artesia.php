			<p>Artesia is an award winning Community developed by Heritage Pointe Properties. I was brought on board to build a custom Wordpress CMS site that will provide users an online platform to learn about Artesia in an interactive, informative and engaging way.</p>
			
			<p>As a lead developer, I worked closely with the graphic designer and user interface designer to develop an online platform, rich with beautiful contents, advanced features and functionalities.</p>

			<p>One of the main challenges is to implement a responsive community map that provides potential clients and future property owners with up-to-date information about the lots and it's availability through a visual tooltips. Other features implemented are smooth content scrolling, carousel gallery, dynamic sub-menu, customized newsletter system, and blogging platform, filterable by category.!
			Overall, the website is informative, highly engaging and most importantly, easily manageable.</p>
