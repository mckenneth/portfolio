	        <p class="lead">KENTON magazine is a leading, global online fashion and lifestyle magazine for young, professional men and women. Bringing readers to the forefront of fashion, culture and society, KENTON magazine delivers original content from an industry insiderâ€™s perspective.</p>

	        <p>After years of successful online publishing, KENTON magazine needed a redesign.  I was presented with the initial design concept and was brought on board to develop a new and improved website.  The challenge:  The design were only in desktop and it was fully up to me to take the initial design and re-imagine it for tablet and mobile browsing experience.</p>  

			<p>The process was both challenging and fulfilling.  KENTON was relaunched with a refreshed visual design, sophisticated backend technology and sleek user interface for a modern, mobile audience.</p>
