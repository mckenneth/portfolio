With offices located in Lethbridge, Medicine Hat, Brooks, Fort McMurray, Taber and Raymond, Stringam works with experienced team, handling a variety of cases in all areas of law, from family and divorce to business, agriculture, and personal injury.! !
In early 2013, I was commissioned to develop a custom Wordpress website for Stringam Denecky. I worked closely with Foundry Communication, alongside Brightside Studios in developing the initial web and user interface designs into a fully functioning responsive website.! !
The final product is a sophisticated, highly customizable website with fully manageable contents.!
