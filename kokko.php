			KOKKO is a luxury retail boutique curating exclusive fashion, art and lifestyle pieces catered towards style savvy consumers. With the company's growing demand for online shopping experience, I was brought on board to launch the company's digital storefront.!
!
KOKKO carries over fifty different brands for both men and women, from ready-to-wear, high- street-wear, to high-fashion. The website is intended to showcase a broad range of designers. One of the main challenges is to come up with a concept that will compliment all the brands while keeping it aligned with KOKKO's identity.!
My approach is to simplify the concept and focus on the key elements that KOKKO's consumers value the most: Products, Usability and Accessibility.!
!
The homepage presents users with strong editorials and campaign images that features enticing photographs of KOKKO's latest offerings. Navigation patterns were kept standard and simple to maintain clarity and accessibility. The layout is clean with crisp typography. A hyperlinked list of all the designers were placed on the sidebar allowing users to navigate from one designer to another with ease.!
The result is an intuitive website that reflects the company's essence. It is minimal, inviting and fully shopable on every screen. !
!
KOKKO were able to successfully extend their reach online and expand the business through it's new digital storefront.!

				<p class="smaller">To make matters worse, if the above code were to define its animation options using Velocity's options object syntax — as opposed to the comma-separated syntax currently demonstrated — it would quickly become a nest of unmanageable code. Additional issues with this nesting approach include having your code expanding horizontally (making it difficult to browse), and the inability to easily re-arrange the order of calls in your sequence.</p>
