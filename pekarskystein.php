		Pekarsky Stein is Western Canada's leading boutique job search firm. In collaboration with Foundry Communications and Brightside Studios, I was commissioned to develop a custom Wordpress site with a fully integrated job posting board.!
!
The challenge: Create a sophisticated backend for the website with all different types of content easily manageable by the client after deployment. I must also develop a job posting board including individual page for each posting, as well as a function for users to easily submit their applications directly to a specific recruiter.!
My approach was to first identify all the different types of content the website will have: Client's testimonial, team member's profile page, blog post and job opportunity. Next is differentiation and establishment of information.!
!
The final result is a customized Wordpress site with fully manageable contents. The job board features filterable data and responsive tables for seamless desktop-to-mobile browsing.!
